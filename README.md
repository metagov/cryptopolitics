# Cryptopolitics: Political, economic, and governance attitudes of blockchain users

## About
The [Cryptopolitical Typology Quiz](https://metagov.typeform.com/cryptopolitics) was developed by the [Metagovernance Project](https://metagov.org/) to help the crypto community understand its political, economic, and governance beliefs. Survey results were collected from September 27, 2021 through March 4, 2022 and have been published on the [Govbase Airtable database](https://airtable.com/shr9LYMni8pBUVD6q/tblvwbt4KFm8MOSUQ). 

This repository contains both a CSV export of the relevant results and the Python code used to visualize the distribution of responses, investigate the importance of blockchain affiliation and self-reported political orientation, and assess the validity of our constructed political score and types against any axes or features that emerge from the data.
